The first column in the dataset is the Class label which is either 1 (Background Signal) and 0 (Made By
Particle) followed by 18 Features. The first 8 features are kinematic properties measured by the particle
detectors in the accelerator. The last ten features are functions of the first 8 features, these are high-level
features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes.
