# Searching-for-Exotic-Particles-in-High-Energy-Physics-Using-Machine-Learning
Collisions at high-energy particle colliders are a traditionally fruitful source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence machine-learning approaches are often used.
